abstract = {Objective
To describe the challenges and perspectives of the automation of pain assessment in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
Data sources
A search for scientific articles published in the last 10 years on automated neonatal pain assessment was conducted in the main Databases of the Health Area and Engineering Journal Portals, using the descriptors: Pain Measurement, Newborn, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Systems, Software, Automated Facial Recognition.
Summary of findings
Fifteen articles were selected and allowed a broad reflection on first, the literature search did not return the various automatic methods that exist to date, and those that exist are not effective enough to replace the human eye; second, computational methods are not yet able to automatically detect pain on partially covered faces and need to be tested during the natural movement of the neonate and with different light intensities; third, for research to advance in this area, databases are needed with more neonatal facial images available for the study of computational methods.
Conclusion
There is still a gap between computational methods developed for automated neonatal pain assessment and a practical application that can be used at the bedside in real-time, that is sensitive, specific, and with good accuracy. The studies reviewed described limitations that could be minimized with the development of a tool that identifies pain by analyzing only free facial regions, and the creation and feasibility of a synthetic database of neonatal facial images that is freely available to researchers.}

	abstract = {Introduction Infants can experience pain similar to adults, and improperly controlled pain stimuli could have a long-term adverse impact on their cognitive and neurological function development. The biggest challenge of achieving good infant pain control is obtaining objective pain assessment when direct communication is lacking. For years, computer scientists have developed many different facial expression-centred machine learning (ML) methods for automatic infant pain assessment. Many of these ML algorithms showed rather satisfactory performance and have demonstrated good potential to be further enhanced for implementation in real-world clinical settings. To date, there is no prior research that has systematically summarised and compared the performance of these ML algorithms. Our proposed meta-analysis will provide the first comprehensive evidence on this topic to guide further ML algorithm development and clinical implementation.Methods and analysis We will search four major public electronic medical and computer science databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Embase and IEEE Xplore Digital Library from January 2008 to present. All the articles will be imported into the Covidence platform for study eligibility screening and inclusion. Study-level extracted data will be stored in the Systematic Review Data Repository online platform. The primary outcome will be the prediction accuracy of the ML model. The secondary outcomes will be model utility measures including generalisability, interpretability and computational efficiency. All extracted outcome data will be imported into RevMan V.5.2.1 software and R V3.3.2 for analysis. Risk of bias will be summarised using the latest Prediction Model Study Risk of Bias Assessment Tool.Ethics and dissemination This systematic review and meta-analysis will only use study-level data from public databases, thus formal ethical approval is not required. The results will be disseminated in the form of an official publication in a peer-reviewed journal and/or presentation at relevant conferences.PROSPERO registration number CRD42019118784.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first investigation into the use of fully automated deep learning framework for assessing neonatal postoperative pain. It specifically investigates the use of Bilinear Convolutional Neural Network (B-CNN) to extract facial features during different levels of postoperative pain followed by modeling the temporal pattern using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Although acute and postoperative pain have some common characteristics (e.g., visual action units), postoperative pain has a different dynamic, and it evolves in a unique pattern over time. Our experimental results indicate a clear difference between the pattern of acute and postoperative pain. They also suggest the efficiency of using a combination of bilinear CNN with RNN model for the continuous assessment of postoperative pain intensity.},
